# Visual_Synthesis
-----
I worked on project titled Audio Visual Synthesis. Problem statement is "For a given speech signal we have to generate
the corresponding lip movements‚Äù. To achieve this, I used a phonetically rich audio-visual database containing
over 9000 sentences spoken by 4 subject. In this work I chose LSTM-RNN model for predicting the lip shape,
as RNN are capable of learning long-term dependencies. Based on the speech input lip shapes were predicted
& a short video of a Talking head was generated .

Pre-Processing of the Video and Audio was done Matlab 
Futher Bi-directional LSTM RNN model was implemented using Keras Library.
